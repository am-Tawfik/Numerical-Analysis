# Numerical-Analysis
Solutions of Non-linear Equations using Numerical Anlaysis Techniques - My first repository on Github 

## Definitions
We know that there are 3 methods for finding the root. Analytical solutions, Graphical methods and Numerical methods. 
This repository will concentrate on numerical mehtods using _Open methods and Bracketing methods_. 
1. Bracketing Method:
   - Bisection method
 
2. Open Method:
   - Newton's Method
   - Fixed Point Iteration

## Used libraries 
I didn't use any library except for ***"rlist"*** library.
