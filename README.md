# Numerical-Analysis
<https://github.com/am-Tawfik/Numerical-Analysis.git>
Solutions of Non-linear Equations using Numerical Anlaysis Techniques 
## Definitions
We know that there are 3 methods for finding the root. Analytical solutions, Graphical methods and Numerical methods. 
This repository will concentrate on numerical mehtods using _Open methods and Bracketing methods_. 
## Programs
1. Taylor Expansion
   - len function.
2. Bracketing Method
   - Bisection method
3. Open Method
   - Newton's Method
   - Fixed Point Iteration

## Technologies used 
1. ***"rlist"*** library. <!-- to get the output in a list to make it a dataframe.-->
2. ***"Rmarkdown"*** library.<!-- to put the codes as a notbook. -->
